# easypop-revised

This repostory provides updated executables for the simulation program, EASYPOP, authored by F. Balloux, (c.f. Balloux, Francois. "EASYPOP (version 1.7): a computer program for population genetics simulations." Journal of heredity 92.3 (2001): 301-302 ).

These executables have been revised and recomiled by T. Cosart for current Linux, Apple, and Windows platforms.  We have replaced the original Windows GUI interface for a terminal usage that mimics the prompt/response format of the original, which was effectivly a terminal inside a Windows frame.  Further, it adds the ability to load a simulation configuration from file, then run the simulation.

In our repository layout, executables are in platform specific subdirectories.  In the "docs" directory, you'll find the author's original user manual in pdf format, as well as documentation detailing the revised input methods and configuration file format.
